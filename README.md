# TextFilterMenu :star:
***Note***: This is a simple Python project from Yandex. 
I posted it on GitHub to see my progress in the future.:sweat_smile:
## My purpose
Create a menu for selecting text filters.
Each filter modifies the entered text according to its functionality.
I need to make a menu that prompts the user to select a text filter from at least three proposed options and apply it to the text.
## Tasks :book:
1) Come up with ideas for filters and descriptions for them.
2) Collect all filters, their names and descriptions into one dictionary.
3) Display a menu with filters from the dictionary.
4) Write a loop that allows the user to select filters to apply until he decides to exit the program.
5) If the user selects a filter, the program should provide him with a description of the selected filter and ask him if he wants to apply the filter to the text.
6) If the user agrees, the program should request the text to which the selected filter will be applied, and display the result of applying the filter. And if the user does not agree, you need to show him the menu again.
7) If the user selects "Exit", the program should exit.
## Installations
Install the current version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Install a Python IDE ([PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.comru-ru/pycharm/download/?section=windows), 
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), etc.)
## Recommendations :point_left:
To understand what each function does, go to file [text.py](text.py) 
and read the description
